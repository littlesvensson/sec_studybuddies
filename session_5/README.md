**Application Observability and Maintenance**
* Understand API deprecations
* Use built-in CLI tools to monitor Kubernetes application

* Demonstrate basic understanding of NetworkPolicies
* Provide and troubleshoot access to applications via services
* Use Ingress rules to expose applications
* Understand authentication, authorization and admission control

### Use built-in CLI tools to monitor Kubernetes application

#### Inspect Pod and Deployment Health

kubectl get pods	Pod status (Running, CrashLoopBackOff, Pending)
kubectl describe pod <pod>	Detailed events, probe results, resource usage, restarts
kubectl logs <pod>	Container stdout/stderr (logs)
kubectl logs -f <pod>	Live log streaming
kubectl get deployment	Deployment status: replicas, available, updated
kubectl rollout status deployment <name>	Rollout progress
kubectl get events

#### Resource Usage Monitoring (requires metrics-server)

kubectl top pod	Shows CPU/memory usage per pod
kubectl top node	Shows node-level resource usage

#### Debugging / Troubleshooting

kubectl exec -it <pod> -- bash	Open a shell in a running container
kubectl cp <pod>:/path /local/path	Copy files from/to a pod
kubectl port-forward <pod> 8080:80	Access pod apps locally via port forwarding 

#### Status and History Checks
Command	What it shows
kubectl get all	All workload resources (pods, svc, rs, etc.) in current namespace
kubectl rollout history deployment <name>	Deployment version history
kubectl get rs	View ReplicaSets tied to a Deployment
kubectl get jobs / cronjobs

### Understand API deprecations

Kubernetes evolves fast. Older API versions are marked as deprecated, then eventually removed in later versions.

If you use a deprecated API, your manifests may fail to work after a Kubernetes upgrade.

How to Recognize Deprecated APIs
Check the apiVersion: field in your YAML.

# DEPRECATED (removed in 1.22)
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment

# CORRECT (current)
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment


Helpful tools/commands
k api-resources
kubectl explain deployment | grep VERSION
k get events

### TASK! (#4)

In the folder `session_3/task3_2`, you will find a file called `sickcronjob.yaml`. Deploy the manifest to your cluster and troubleshoot any issues that arise.

Stuck on the way? Check the solution in `session_3/task3_2/solution.md`.
