SESSION 6, 11.7.2025 
========================

## Content of the session:

**Application Observability and Maintenance**
* Understand API deprecations
* Use built-in CLI tools to monitor Kubernetes application

**Application Environment, Configuration and Security**
* Understand requests, limits, quotas, Define resource requirements
* Understand Application Security (SecurityContexts, Capabilities, etc.)
* Understand authentication, authorization and admission control

### Understand API deprecations

Kubernetes evolves fast. Older API versions are marked as deprecated, then eventually removed in later versions.

If you use a deprecated API, your manifests may fail to work after a Kubernetes upgrade.

How to Recognize Deprecated APIs
Check the apiVersion: field in your YAML.


Helpful tools/commands
```bash
# Check available API versions
k api-resources
kubectl explain deployment | grep VERSION
```

### TASK! (#1)

In the folder [task5_4](./task5_4/), you will find a file called [sadcronjob.yaml](./task5_1/sadcronjob.yaml). Deploy the manifest to your cluster and troubleshoot any issues that arise.

Stuck on the way? Check the solution in [session_5/task5_4/solution.md](/session_5/task5_1/solution.md).


### Use built-in CLI tools to monitor Kubernetes application

Kubernetes provides several built-in CLI tools to monitor and troubleshoot applications running in the cluster. During our sessions, we have aleady used most of them, but let's summarize them:

#### Inspect Pod and Deployment Health

**k get po**:	Pod status (Running, CrashLoopBackOff, Pending) <br>
**k get po -A**:	All pods in all namespaces <br>
**k get all**:	All workload resources (basically all pods and their controllers + services) in current namespace <br>
**k get all -A**: When you want everything :) <br>
**k describe po <pod>**:	Detailed events, probe results, resource usage, restarts <br>
**k logs <pod>**:	Container stdout/stderr (logs) <br>
**k logs <pod> -c <container>**:	Specific container logs in a multi-container pod <br>
**k logs <pod> --previous**:	Previous container logs (if restarted) <br>
**k logs <pod> -l app=<label>**:	Filter logs by label selector <br>
**k logs deployment/<deployment>**:	Choosing one random pod from the deployment to get logs <br>
**k logs -f <pod>**:	Live log streaming <br>
**k get deploy**:	Deployment status: replicas, available, updated <br>
**k rollout status deployment <name>**:	Rollout progress <br>
**k rollout history deployment <name>**:	Deployment version history <br>
**k describe <resource type> <name>**:	Detailed resource information (events, conditions, etc.) <br>
**k get events**: Recent events in the cluster (e.g., pod restarts, scheduling issues) <br>

>Note: the difference between logs and events is that logs are the output of the application running inside the container, while events are Kubernetes system messages about actions taken on resources (like pod restarts, scheduling, etc.). When debuggin, you might need to inspect both of them.

#### Resource Usage Monitoring (requires metrics-server)

k top po:	Shows CPU/memory usage per pod
k top no:	Shows node-level resource usage

#### Debugging / Troubleshooting

k exec -it <pod> -- bash	Open a shell in a running container
k port-forward <pod> <local port on your machine>:<remote port on the pod>	Access pod apps locally via port forwarding 

```bash
k run little-port-test --image=nginx --port=80
k port-forward pod/little-port-test 8080:80

curl http://localhost:8080
```
### TASK! (#2)

In the folder [task6_2](./task6_2/), you will find manifest definitions within the file [scenario.yaml](./task6_2/scenario.yaml). Apply them to your cluster and then troubleshoot any issues that arise.

Let's **DISCUSS** what you found out!

## Application Security (SecurityContexts, Capabilities, etc.)

For the CKAD exam, you need to understand how to use SecurityContexts and basic Linux capabilities within pods and containers.

#### SecurityContext

A SecurityContext is used to define security-related settings for pods or containers (e.g., user IDs, privilege level, filesystem settings).

There are two levels:

**1. Pod-level SecurityContext in `spec.securityContext`**
Applies to all containers in the pod.

```bash
k explain pod.spec.securityContext --recursive
```

```yaml
...

FIELDS:
  fsGroup	<integer>
  fsGroupChangePolicy	<string>
  runAsGroup	<integer>
  runAsNonRoot	<boolean>
  runAsUser	<integer>
  seLinuxOptions	<SELinuxOptions>
    level	<string>
    role	<string>
    type	<string>
    user	<string>
  seccompProfile	<SeccompProfile>
    localhostProfile	<string>
    type	<string> -required-
    enum: Localhost, RuntimeDefault, Unconfined
  supplementalGroups	<[]integer>
  sysctls	<[]Sysctl>
    name	<string> -required-
    value	<string> -required-
  windowsOptions	<WindowsSecurityContextOptions>
    gmsaCredentialSpec	<string>
    gmsaCredentialSpecName	<string>
    hostProcess	<boolean>
    runAsUserName	<string>
```

**2. Container-level SecurityContext in `spec.containers[].securityContext`
**
Overrides pod-level for the specific container.

```bash
k explain pod.spec.containers.securityContext --recursive
```
```yaml
FIELDS:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation	<boolean>
  capabilities	<Capabilities>
    add	<[]string>
    drop	<[]string>
  privileged	<boolean>
  procMount	<string>
  readOnlyRootFilesystem	<boolean>
  runAsGroup	<integer>
  runAsNonRoot	<boolean>
  runAsUser	<integer>
  seLinuxOptions	<SELinuxOptions>
    level	<string>
    role	<string>
    type	<string>
    user	<string>
  seccompProfile	<SeccompProfile>
    localhostProfile	<string>
    type	<string> -required-
    enum: Localhost, RuntimeDefault, Unconfined
  windowsOptions	<WindowsSecurityContextOptions>
    gmsaCredentialSpec	<string>
    gmsaCredentialSpecName	<string>
    hostProcess	<boolean>
    runAsUserName	<string>
```
> Note: When you define a securityContext at both the pod and container level, the container-level settings take precedence over the pod-level settings.

> Note2: In CKAD, you will most likely be instructed to set the SecurityContext either for pod or particular container with specific fields given by the task.


* **runAsGroup <integer>**: specifies the primary group ID (GID) the container's main process should run as. It is the primary group the process belongs to. Each file or directory can grant read, write, execute permissions to a group (via the GID). If your process runs with a specific GID, it can access files and directories owned by that group, assuming the permissions allow it.
* **runAsUser	<integer>**: specifies the user ID (UID) the container's main process should run as. It is the user that owns the process. This is important for file permissions, as files created by the process will be owned by this UID.
* **runAsNonRoot	<boolean>**: ensures the container's main process does not run as the root user (UID 0). This is a security measure to prevent privilege escalation.
* **capabilities**: Linux capabilities let you drop or add fine-grained privileges to the container's process. For example, you can drop the `NET_ADMIN` capability to prevent network configuration changes.
* **privileged**: Allows the container to access host-level resources (which is **dangerous**).
* **readOnlyRootFilesystem**: Makes the container's root filesystem read-only. This prevents the container from modifying files in its root directory, which can enhance security.

For CKAD, you need to know how to set securityContext above mentioned fields (and ideally understand what they mean :) .

### TASK! (#3)

Create a Deployment named secure-app with the following specifications:
* Namespace: studybuddies
* Name: secure-joke
* 1 replica.
* curlimages/curl
* The container should run as user ID 1000.
* The container should use a read-only root filesystem.
* Command: curl -s https://icanhazdadjoke.com/

Once done, write your joke from the logs to the channel chat!

## Resource management

### 1. Resource Requests and Limits
These control how much CPU and memory your pod can use.

Requests = guaranteed minimum

Limits = hard maximum

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "64Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
  limits:
    memory: "128Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
``` 

What it means:
The container gets at least 64Mi and 250m CPU

The container canâ€™t exceed 128Mi or 500m CPU

CPU is in millicores (500m = 0.5 CPU)

Memory is in bytes, e.g. Mi, Gi



You might be required to define requests/limits in exam tasks

Your pod might fail to schedule if a node doesn't have enough resources for the request

If a pod uses too much memory, it might be OOMKilled if it exceeds the memory limit

ResourceQuota and LimitRange
 LimitRange
Automatically applies default limits/requests to pods in a namespace.

Prevents pods from running without resource constraints.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: mem-limit
  namespace: myns
spec:
  limits:
  - default:
      memory: 256Mi
    defaultRequest:
      memory: 128Mi
    type: Container
```
ResourceQuota
Limits total resources in a namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: compute-quota
  namespace: myns
spec:
  hard:
    pods: "10"
    requests.cpu: "1"
    requests.memory: "1Gi"
    limits.cpu: "2"
    limits.memory: "2Gi"
```


### TASK! (#4)







## Understand authentication, authorization and admission control

  Knowing that Pods use service accounts
    Understanding how to give a service account permissions (which uses Role/RoleBinding)
    Being able to troubleshoot permission errors (e.g., app can't list pods)
    Knowing that authorization is required when your app talks to the Kubernetes API

1. Authentication (Who are you?)
Kubernetes checks who is making the request.

This could be a user, service account, or external identity (via certificates, tokens, etc.).

Most commonly in CKAD, this shows up when:

Your pod is running with a service account

You get Unauthorized errors if the kubeconfig is wrong or permissions are missing

CKAD-level takeaway:
Be aware that service accounts are how workloads authenticate to the API server.

2. Authorization (What can you do?)
After identifying who, Kubernetes checks what theyâ€™re allowed to do.

It uses things like:

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) â€” the most common

kubectl auth can-i to test permissions

CKAD-level takeaway:

Know how to check if your service account or user can perform an action:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl auth can-i get pods --as system:serviceaccount:myns:myaccount
3. Admission Control (Should we allow it?)
Runs after authentication and authorization, before the object is persisted.

Controls like:

ValidatingAdmissionWebhook

MutatingAdmissionWebhook

LimitRanges, PodSecurity, ResourceQuotas

 CKAD-level takeaway:

You may encounter errors from things like a validating webhook or namespace quota.

For example:

"Pod denied: CPU request too high"

"Missing label required by policy"

 In Practice
Component	What it does	CKAD relevance
Authentication	Identifies the requestor	Mostly behind the scenes
Authorization	Approves/rejects based on roles	Important when using service accounts, RBAC
Admission control	Final checks/patches before storing	May block objects if they violate policy

 What You Should Practice
Create and use service accounts

Set automountServiceAccountToken: false when needed

Use kubectl auth can-i to troubleshoot permissions

Recognize common admission control errors in kubectl describe or kubectl get events
